I'm Carlos Abreu
My favourite sport is football and Messi is the favourite player. 
That's the sport I best know how to play and that's has been since childhood.
Favourite food is Brazilian black bean stew with brown rice. Instead pork loin or smoked sausage I prefer it with checkin meat.

Favourite musics:
Daniel Bedingfield - If You're Not The One:

The thing that really enjoy to do is reading, programming, be aware about what's going on in the world reading new on curate internet news and watching documentaries on TVs or NetFlix and have night out with friends and girlfriend.
