I'm Carlos Abreu
My favourite sport is football and Messi is the best and favourite player in the world. 
That's the sport I best know how to play and it's has been since childhood.
Favourite dishes are Portuguese cod fish and Brazilian black bean stew with brown rice. Instead pork loin or smoked sausage I prefer it with chicken meat.

Favourite music:
Daniel Bedingfield - If You're Not The One:

The thing that I really enjoy to do is reading, programming, be aware about what's going on in the world reading news on curate internet sites and watching documentaries on TVs or NetFlix and have night out with friends and girlfriend.
